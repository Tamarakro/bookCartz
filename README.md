# Book Cart App
This is the repository for the backend of my proposed online book shopping app where users can shop for books online.
Basically users should be able to create an account, login to that account after being authenticated and also be able to browse for what ever book they want based on the genres they select.
The following endpoints based on certain user stories have been proposed to be created :

ADMIN(baseUrl = "/api/v1/admin")
  1. findById(baseUrl/user/Id) : This endpoint ensures the admins can search for a user as at when required.(Get Mapping, @pathVariable = id)
  2. findAll(baseUrl/user) : This endpoint returns a list of all the current users or registered accounts.(Get Mapping)
  3. deleteById(baseUrl/user/id) : This endpoint gives the admin the power to delete a particular user.(Delete Mapping, @pathVariable = id)
  4. addBook(baserUrl/book) : This endpoint allows the admin to add books as at when necessary.(Post Mapping, @requestBody = bookRequest)
The above endpoints are only accessible to the Admin

USER(baseUrl = "/api/v1/user")
  1. addbookToCart(baseUrl/book/id) : This endpoint enables users add book to their cart so they can checkout when necessary.(Patch Mapping, @requestBody = BookDto, @Pathvariable = id)
  2. findBookById(baseUrl/book/id) : This endpoint enables users search for a particular book in their cart.(Get Mapping, @pathVariable = id)
  3. updateDetails(baseUrl/details/id) : This endpoints helps users update their profile where necessary.(Patch Mapping, @pathVariable = id, @requestBody = updatedUser)
  4. findAllBooks(baseUrl/Book) : Retrieves all the books in users cart.
The above endpoints are only accessible to the user

AUTHENTIFICATION(baseUrl = "/api/v1/auth")
  1. register(baseUrl/register) : This enables both users and admins to be able to register for the app.(Post Mapping, @RequestBody = registerRequest)
  2. authentification(baseUrl/authenticate) : This gives users and admins access to the required endpoints(Post Mapping, @RequestBody = authenticationRequest)
The above endpoints are secured hence need no authentifiation

GENERAL(baseUrl = "/api/v1/book")
  1. findBookByGenre(baseUrl/genre) : This endpoint allows both users and admins to check for books according to their genre.(Get Mapping)
  2. findAllBooks(baseUrl) : This endpoints allows both users and admin to look through all the books regardless of genre.(Get Mapping)
